    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and lifetime risk (LTR) of Parkinson disease (PD) in a large cohort of men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: Age is the strongest risk factor for PD, but whether its incidence continues to increase after age 80 years remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Prospective cohort of 21,970 US male physicians aged 40-84 years at baseline who did not report PD before study entry. Participants self-reported PD on yearly follow-up questionnaires, and all deaths were confirmed. We calculated incidence rates and cumulative incidence using a modified Kaplan-Meier analysis. LTR was estimated by adjusting cumulative incidence for competing risks of death.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Five hundred sixty-three cases of PD were identified over 23 years of follow-up. The crude incidence rate of PD was 121 cases/100,000 person-years. Age-specific incidence rates increased sharply beginning at age 60 years, peaked in those aged 85-89 years, and declined beginning at age 90 years. Cumulative incidence substantially overestimated the long-term risk of PD, particularly in those aged 80 years and older. Cumulative incidence was 9.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 8.48{\%}-11.30{\%}) from ages 45 to 100 years, whereas LTR for the same period was 6.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 6.01{\%}-7.43{\%}). The incidence and LTR of PD decreased with increasing exposure to smoking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that the incidence of Parkinson disease (PD) in men increases through age 89 years. Whether the subsequent decline represents a true decrease in risk remains to be established. A history of smoking substantially decreased the incidence and lifetime risk of PD. Incidence studies that do not adjust for competing risks of death may overestimate the true risk of PD in the elderly.},

    abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for ∼2.7{\%} of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for {\textgreater}20{\%} of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},
